# JS_book_RICK
Hello World
Thanks for Rick Sekuloski
I started this book a week ago. It is called "JavaScript from Zero to Hero".
In order to be understandable I will edit this file if I don't comprehend codes. Or I will put a comment for my followers. When they upload my repo. Everything would be clearly.
